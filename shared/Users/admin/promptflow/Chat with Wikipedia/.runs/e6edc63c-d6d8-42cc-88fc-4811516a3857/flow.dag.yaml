        question: What is ChatGPT?
      outputs:
        answer: ChatGPT is a chatbot product developed by OpenAI. It is powered by the
          Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series of language models,
          with GPT-4 being the latest version. ChatGPT uses natural language
          processing to generate responses to user inputs in a conversational
          manner. It was released as ChatGPT Plus, a premium version, which
          provides enhanced features and access to the GPT-4 based version of
          OpenAI's API. ChatGPT allows users to interact and have conversations
          with the language model, utilizing both text and image inputs. It is
          designed to be more reliable, creative, and capable of handling
          nuanced instructions compared to previous versions. However, it is
          important to note that while GPT-4 improves upon its predecessors, it
          still retains some of the same limitations and challenges.
