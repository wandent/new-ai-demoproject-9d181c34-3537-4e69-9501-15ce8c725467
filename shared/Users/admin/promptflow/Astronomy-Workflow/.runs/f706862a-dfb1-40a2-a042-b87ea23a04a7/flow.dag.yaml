        question: Is there any controversy regarding the fact that Pluto stopped to be a planet ?
        subject: astronomy
      outputs:
        answer: |-
          Yes, there is some controversy surrounding the reclassification of Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined the criteria for what qualifies as a planet, and under these new criteria, Pluto did not meet the requirements to be classified as a planet. 

          This decision was met with mixed reactions from the scientific community and the general public. Some scientists and astronomers disagreed with the reclassification, arguing that the new definition was too narrow and that Pluto should still be considered a planet. Others supported the reclassification, stating that it was important to have a clear and consistent definition of what constitutes a planet.

          The controversy surrounding the reclassification of Pluto continues to be a topic of discussion and debate among astronomers and the public. It's important to note that the scientific consensus, as represented by the IAU, currently classifies Pluto as a dwarf planet. 

          For more information on the controversy surrounding Pluto's classification, you can refer to scientific articles and publications that discuss the topic in detail.

        question: And why Ceres is now known as a Planet, instead of Pluto ?
        subject: astronomy

        answer: |-
          Ceres is not currently classified as a planet. It is classified as a dwarf planet, similar to Pluto. 

          The reclassification of Pluto and the creation of the category of dwarf planets were based on the new criteria established by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006. According to these criteria, a celestial body must meet three requirements to be classified as a planet:

          1. It must orbit the Sun.
          2. It must be spherical in shape, meaning it has enough self-gravity to pull itself into a nearly round shape.
          3. It must have cleared its orbit of other debris, meaning it has become gravitationally dominant in its orbital neighborhood.

          While Pluto meets the first two criteria, it does not meet the third criterion because it shares its orbit with other objects in the Kuiper Belt. Therefore, it was reclassified as a dwarf planet.

          Ceres, on the other hand, is located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It is spherical in shape and orbits the Sun, but it has not cleared its orbit of other debris. As a result, Ceres is classified as a dwarf planet.

          It's important to note that scientific classifications are subject to change as our understanding of celestial bodies evolves. For more information on the classification of dwarf planets, you can refer to resources such as scientific articles and publications on the topic.
